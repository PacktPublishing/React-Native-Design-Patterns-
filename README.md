## About the Video Course
Design Patterns are time-tested solutions that can be utilized as guidelines in your current work. Utilizing Design Patterns enhances code readability, improves the scalability of your applications, and defines a common language with other developers. 
In this course, you will develop an understanding of different Design Patterns and understand why a specific pattern was created, and how it should be implemented. By working on practical examples, you will learn how mobile development in React Native should be performed in a reusable way.
By the end of the course, you will be adept at utilizing the best solution for a given problem in your next React Native application.
